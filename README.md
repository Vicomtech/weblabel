# WebLabel

WebLabel is a web application to create, edit and visualize annotations (often called labels or tags) in OpenLABEL format.

The application can load JSON files in OpenLABEL format for a wide variety of labeling use cases:

* 2D Bounding boxes in images/videos
* 3D Cuboids in point clouds
* 2D/3D polylines and polygons
* Time-events and actions
* Time-consistent objects (with UID)

WebLabel manages OpenLABEL content using the [Video Content Description (VCD)](https://github.com/Vicomtech/video-content-description-VCD) library.

## OpenLABEL

[ASAM OpenLABEL](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/openlabel/) defines the annotation format and labeling methods for objects and scenarios. ASAM OpenLABEL provides a guideline on how the labeling methods and definitions should be used.

WebLabel supports (loads, create, visualize) labels compliant with ASAM OpenLABEL 1.0.

## VCD

[Video Content Description](https://github.com/Vicomtech/video-content-description-VCD) is the library which manages OpenLABEL content, with an API that allows creating, modifying, reading and writing labels in OpenLABEL format.

WebLabel uses the [VCD NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vcd-ts).
